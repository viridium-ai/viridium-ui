<h1>Emission factors</h1>

<p>Emission factors are the rates used to calculate
      greenhouse emission for an emission inventory item.
    
    It is important to choose the most relevant and 
    reliable emissions factors and to carefully 
    consider the assumptions and limitations of the methods used. 
</p>

<h2>Here are a few of the most commonly used sources</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Greenhouse Gas Protocol: The Greenhouse Gas Protocol is an internationally recognized accounting and reporting standard for greenhouse gas emissions. It provides a comprehensive set of emissions factors for calculating Scope 3 emissions, including emissions from the production of purchased goods and services, business travel, and employee commuting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): The IPCC provides guidance and methodologies for estimating greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions factors for specific activities, such as land use change and forestry, agriculture, and waste management.
    
    </li>
    <li>
        National and regional databases: Many countries and regions have their own databases of emissions factors, which can be more specific to local conditions and sources of emissions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency provides emissions factors for transportation, industrial processes, and product use.

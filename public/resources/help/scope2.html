<h1>Scope 2 Emission</h1>
<p>
    Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, heat, or steam that an organization uses. These emissions are generated by the electricity or heat supplier, not the end-user, but are still considered part of the end-user's carbon footprint.

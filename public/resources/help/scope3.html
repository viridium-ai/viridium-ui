<h1>Scope 3 Emission</h1>
<p>
    Scope 3 emission counts the CO2 and its equivalents due products, services, and activities your business external
    partners in order to produce your product
    or provide your services.
</p>
<p>There are 15 categories used for segregating different ways of calculating the emission</p>
<h2>
    Categories for Scope 3 emission
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Purchased Goods and Services</li>
    <li>Capital Goods</li>
    <li>Fuel and Energy related activities (not included in scope 1 or 2)</li>
    <li>Upstream transportation and distribution</li>
    <li>Waste generated in operations</li>
    <li>Business Travel</li>
    <li>Employee commuting</li>
    <li>Upstream leased Assets</li>
    <li>Transportation and distribution of sold products</li>
    <li>Processing of Sold Products</li>
    <li>Use of sold products</li>
    <li>End of life treatment of sold products</li>
    <li>Downstream leased assets</li>
    <li>Franchises</li>
    <li>Investments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Here is a general approach for calculating Scope 3 emissions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Identify sources of emissions: Determine the categories that apply to your organization and
        identify the specific activities that contribute to each category.

    </li>
    <li>
        Collect data: Collect data on the activities that contribute to each category, such as the
        quantities of materials purchased, the distances traveled, and the energy consumed.

    </li>
    <li>
        Determine emissions factors: Use emissions factors, which are numerical values that
         represent the amount of
        greenhouse gas emissions per unit of activity, to convert the data into emissions. 
        Emissions factors can be
        found in various sources, such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol,
         the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
        and national and regional databases.

    </li>
    <li>
        Calculate emissions: Use the emissions factors to calculate the
         emissions for each category
        by multiplying the emissions factor by the activity data.

    </li>
    <li>
        Total emissions: Add up the emissions from each category to determine 
        the total Scope 3 emissions for your
        organization.
    </li>
</ul>

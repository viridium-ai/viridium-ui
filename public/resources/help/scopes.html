<h1>GHG Scopes</h1>
<p>
    
The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol is a widely-used accounting tool for measuring, managing and reporting greenhouse gas emissions. It was developed jointly by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in 1998 and is now considered a global standard for GHG accounting.
</p><p>
The GHG Protocol provides a standardized framework for measuring and reporting GHG emissions from various sources, including direct emissions from facilities (such as emissions from boilers or vehicles), indirect emissions from purchased electricity, and other indirect emissions such as those from the extraction and production of purchased materials.
</p><p>
The GHG Protocol provides two main standards for emissions accounting: the Corporate Standard, which provides guidance for companies to measure and manage their GHG emissions, and the Product Standard, which provides guidance for companies to measure and manage the emissions associated with their products.
</p><p>
The GHG Protocol is widely used by governments, businesses, and other organizations around the world to track and manage their GHG emissions, set targets for reduction, and report on their progress. It has also been used as a basis for developing carbon offset projects and trading schemes.
</p><p>
Overall, the GHG Protocol is an important tool for promoting transparency and accountability in emissions reporting and helping organizations to better understand and manage their environmental impacts.

<h2>Scope 1 Emission</h2>
<p>
    Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources 
    that are owned or controlled by an organization. This typically 
    includes emissions from combustion of fossil fuels in boilers,
     vehicles, and other on-site equipment.
</p>
<h2>
    Possible Sources
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Stationary transportation</li>
    <li>Mobile transportation</li>
    <li>Electricity generator</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope 2 Emission</h2>
<p>
    Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, heat, or steam that an organization uses. These emissions are generated by the electricity or heat supplier, not the end-user, but are still considered part of the end-user's carbon footprint.
</p>
<h3>
    Topics
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Locations, or sites where the energy products are used</li>
    <li>Contracts with distributors if any, and how much</li>
    <li>Amount of electricity, heat, steam by month, quarter, or year</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope 3</h2>
<p>
    Scope 3 emission counts the CO2 and its equivalents due products, services, and activities your business external
    partners in order to produce your product
    or provide your services.
</p>
<p>There are 15 categories used for segregating different ways of calculating the emission</p>
<h3>
    Categories for Scope 3 emission
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Purchased Goods and Services</li>
    <li>Capital Goods</li>
    <li>Fuel and Energy related activities (not included in scope 1 or 2)</li>
    <li>Upstream transportation and distribution</li>
    <li>Waste generated in operations</li>
    <li>Business Travel</li>
    <li>Employee commuting</li>
    <li>Upstream leased Assets</li>
    <li>Transportation and distribution of sold products</li>
    <li>Processing of Sold Products</li>
    <li>Use of sold products</li>
    <li>End of life treatment of sold products</li>
    <li>Downstream leased assets</li>
    <li>Franchises</li>
    <li>Investments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Here is a general approach for calculating Scope 3 emissions</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Identify sources of emissions: Determine the categories that apply to your organization and
        identify the specific activities that contribute to each category.

    </li>
    <li>
        Collect data: Collect data on the activities that contribute to each category, such as the
        quantities of materials purchased, the distances traveled, and the energy consumed.

    </li>
    <li>
        Determine emissions factors: Use emissions factors, which are numerical values that
         represent the amount of
        greenhouse gas emissions per unit of activity, to convert the data into emissions. 
        Emissions factors can be
        found in various sources, such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol,
         the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
        and national and regional databases.

    </li>
    <li>
        Calculate emissions: Use the emissions factors to calculate the
         emissions for each category
        by multiplying the emissions factor by the activity data.

    </li>
    <li>
        Total emissions: Add up the emissions from each category to determine 
        the total Scope 3 emissions for your
        organization.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>The Value Chain</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    The value chain is designed to ensure that all stakeholders (company, customers, and business partners)
    receive the highest level of value and service possible. To achieve this, activities ranging from 
    infrastructure design and construction to daily operations and customer service must all be carefully
    coordinated.
</p>
<p> You might be wondering how this worksâ€”take an airport, for example. The airport's value chain
    refers to the set of activities that create and deliver value to passengers, airlines, and other stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    While there are many ways of grouping these activities, Viridium AI groups these categories based on 
    sustainability goals. 
</p>
<p>To continue with the airport example, the following categories can be used: </p>
<h2>Categories for an airport</h2>
<h3>
    Infrastructure
</h3>
<p> This includes the design, construction, and maintenance of the airport's physical
    infrastructure, such as: runways, taxiways, terminals, parking facilities,
    and other buildings and structures.
</p>
<h3>
    Operations
</h3>
<p> This involves the day-to-day activities of running an airport, such as: air traffic control,
    baggage handling, security, cleaning, and maintenance.
</p>
<h3>
    Customer service
</h3>
<p> This includes all activities related to the passenger experience,
    such as: check-in, security screening, boarding, retail,
    food and beverage, and other amenities.
</p>
<h3>
    Commercial activities
</h3>
<p> This includes all activities related to generating revenue from airlines,
    tenants, and other customers, such as: leasing space to airlines and retail
    tenants, parking fees, and other ancillary services.
</p>
<h3>Support services</h3>
<p>This includes all activities that are necessary to support the core functions of the airport,
    such as: finance, HR, legal, IT, and marketing.
</p>
<h2>Subcategories</h2>
<p> Value measurements at top level categories are quite complex as they require a lot of data from many 
    different sources. Accurate measurements are obtained through aggregating subcategories, as they have 
    the data for each specific category. As a result, value chains are often hierarchical, much like a 
    taxonomy tree used for classifying living things. 
</p>

<h1>Partners' Value Chain</h1>
<p>
    In order to get the full picture of a company's sustainability impact, you also have to look at the role
    its partners' value chain plays. For example, an airline will also have to take into consideration the
    construction companies that built the runway, along with the coffee shops that rent the airport's retail
    space. While it is often very difficult to collect this data, with proper disclosure rules and a common
    platform, it could become a possibility.

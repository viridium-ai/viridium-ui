<h1>The value chain</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    Overall, the value chain is designed to ensure that all stakeholders,
    including the company, its customers, and its business partners,
    receive the highest level of value and service possible.
    This requires careful coordination of all activities,
    from infrastructure design and construction to day-to-day
    operations and customer service.
</p>
<p> For example, the value chain for an airport refers to the set of activities
    that take place to
    create and deliver value to passengers, airlines, and other stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    There are many ways of grouping these activities. A common taxonomy would be based
    on business units in a company. The categories can vary, for Viridium AI, they are grouped
    for the purpose for sustainability.
</p>
<p>For example, for an airport, the following categories can be used. </p>
<h2>Categories for an Airport</h2>
<h3>
    Infrastructure
</h3>
<p> This includes the design, construction, and maintenance of the airport's physical
    infrastructure, such as runways, taxiways, terminals, parking facilities,
    and other buildings and structures.
</p>
<h3>
    Operations
</h3>
<p> This involves the day-to-day activities of running an airport, such as air traffic control,
    baggage handling, security, cleaning, and maintenance.
</p>
<h3>
    Customer service
</h3>
<p> This includes all activities related to passenger experience,
    such as check-in, security screening, boarding, retail,
    food and beverage, and other amenities.
</p>
<h3>
    Commercial activities
</h3>
<p> This includes all activities related to generating revenue from airlines,
    tenants, and other customers, such as leasing space to airlines and retail
    tenants, parking fees, and other ancillary services.
</p>
<h3>Support services</h3>
<p>This includes all activities that are necessary to support the core functions of the airport,
    such as finance, HR, legal, IT, and marketing.
</p>
<h2>Sub categories</h2>
<p>While the value measurements at top level categories are required, it is not typically
    obtained at this level, rather they are aggregated up from sub categories where
    the specific information needed for measurements are available. This categorization
    can and often is hierarchical, that forms a taxonomy tree for the value chain activities.
</p>

<h1>Partner's value chain</h1>
<p>
    To get full picture of the sustainability impact of a company, its partner's value chain
    also plays a role.
    This is because the cost of the product and or service by the partners have direct impact on the
    cost of the product or service provided by the company. For example, Airline that uses the airport,
    construction companies that build runway. coffee shops that rent the retain space etc.

    It is often very hard to collect such information, but with proper disclosure rules, and a
    common platform it could become a possibility.
